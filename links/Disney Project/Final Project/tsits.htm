      <article id="tsits">
	  <p>After the King of England, Uther Pendragon, dies, 
			leaving no heir to the throne, a sword magically appears inside an anvil in London.
			The sword bears an inscription proclaiming that "whoso pulleth out this sword of this 
			stone and anvil is rightwise king born of England". No one can remove the sword, which 
			is eventually forgotten, leaving England in the Dark Ages.
			Years later, a 12-year-old orphan named Arthur, commonly called Wart, accidentally scares 
			off a deer his older foster brother Kay was hunting, causing Kay to launch his arrow into 
			the forest. In attempting to retrieve the arrow, Arthur lands in the cottage of Merlin 
			the wizard, who declares himself Arthur's tutor and returns with the boy to his home,
			a castle run by Sir Ector, Arthur's foster father. Ector's friend, Sir Pellinore, 
			arrives with news that the annual jousting tournament will be held on New Year's Day
			in London, and the winner will be crowned king. Ector decides to put Kay through serious 
			training for the tournament and appoints Arthur as Kay's squire.
			In order to educate Arthur, Merlin transforms the boy and himself into fish. They swim in 
			the castle moat in order to learn about physics. Arthur is attacked by a pike but is
			saved by Archimedes, Merlin's pet owl. Arthur is sent to the kitchen as punishment for 
			trying to relate his lesson to a disbelieving Ector.
