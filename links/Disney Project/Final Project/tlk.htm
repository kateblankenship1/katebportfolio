		<p>In the Pride Lands of Africa, a lion rules over the animal kingdom from Pride Rock. 
		King Mufasa's newborn son, Simba, is presented to the assembled animals by Rafiki, a 
		mandrill who serves as shaman and advisor. Mufasa shows young Simba the Pride Lands and 
		explains to him the responsibilities of kingship and the "circle of life" which connects 
		all living things. Mufasa's younger brother, Scar, covets the throne and plots to eliminate
		Mufasa and Simba so he may become king. He tricks Simba and his best friend Nala—to whom
		Simba is betrothed—into exploring a forbidden elephants' graveyard, where they are attacked 
		by three spotted hyenas who are in league with Scar. Mufasa is alerted to the danger by his
		majordomo, the hornbill Zazu, and rescues the cubs. Though angry with Simba, Mufasa forgives
		him and explains that the great kings of the past watch over them from the night sky, from 
		which he will one day watch over Simba.
		Scar sets a trap for his brother and nephew, luring Simba into a gorge and having the hyenas 
		drive a large herd of wildebeest into a stampede that will trample him. He informs Mufasa of 
		Simba's peril, knowing the king will rush to save his son. Mufasa saves Simba but ends up 
		hanging perilously from the gorge's edge and is betrayed by Scar, who sends him falling to 
		his death. Scar convinces Simba that the tragedy was Simba's own fault and advises him to
		flee the kingdom. He orders the hyenas to kill the cub, but Simba escapes.
