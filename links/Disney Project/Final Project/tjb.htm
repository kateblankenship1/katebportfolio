      <article id="tjb"><p>Mowgli, a young orphan boy, is found in a basket in the deep jungles of 
	  India by Bagheera, a black panther who promptly takes him to a mother wolf who has 
	  just had cubs. She raises him along with her own cubs and Mowgli soon becomes well
	  acquainted with jungle life. Mowgli is shown ten years later, playing with his wolf siblings.
	One night, when the wolf tribe learns that Shere Khan, a man-eating Bengal tiger, has returned 
	to the jungle, they realize that Mowgli must be taken to the "Man-Village" for his (and their) 
	own safety. Bagheera volunteers to escort him back. They leave that very night, but Mowgli is
	determined to stay in the jungle. He and Bagheera rest in a tree for the night, where Kaa, a 
	hungry Indian python, tries to devour Mowgli, but Bagheera intervenes. The next morning, Mowgli 
	tries to join the elephant patrol led by Colonel Hathi and his wife Winifred. Bagheera finds Mowgli,
	but after a fight decides to leave Mowgli on his own. Mowgli soon meets up with the laid-back,
	fun-loving sloth bear Baloo, who promises to raise Mowgli himself and never take him back to the Man-Village.
