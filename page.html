        <h4>Introduction</h4>
      </header>
          <p>Hello! My name is Katelyn Blankenship. I am a 22 year old student in Washington state who is looking to switch careers
            from working in the veterinary field as an assistant, to becoming a full time web developer and digital artist. Me and
            my husband live in a quaint little apartment with our two cats, two gerbils, and hamster.</p>

        <h4>My Experience</h4>
      </header>
          <p>I have been studying web development at an introductory level part-time for the last year and a half. I have taken
            a few courses through my local community college as well as online, through Udemy and CodeAcademy. I am currently
            building my education through University of Washington's certificate in front-end web development.</p>

        <h4>My Work</h4>
      </header>
          <p>I have spent most of my junior high and high school years self-teaching myself and practicing my digital art skills at home.
            I dabble with photo manipulation using .GIMP and am currently learning how to draw digitally using my Surface Pro and Cortel PaintShop.</p>
